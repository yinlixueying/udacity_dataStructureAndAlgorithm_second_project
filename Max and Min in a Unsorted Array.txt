Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

This problem ask us to solve it in O(n) time, better in single traversal, so I choose the list[0] as the min and max value, when doing traverse, if the value is smaller than list[0], the update the min value, same as max value.

time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(1)

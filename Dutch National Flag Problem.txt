Dutch National Flag Problem

For this problem, because it only has 3 values 0, 1, 2 and we need single traversal(requirement), so choose 1 as the median number, we need 3 position start, pointer, end. 
if pointer value < 1, then swap the number in start and poiner, start++ï¼Œpointer++
if pointer value = 1, then pointer++
if pointer value > 1, then swap end and pointer value, end--

time complexity: O(n)
space complecity: O(1)

HTTPRouter using a Trie

This is also a Trie structure, the only difference is Trie is storing character but HTTPRouter is storing string.
Coding is similar to Trie code, but in this project splitter and error handler is provided. 

RouteTrieNode:
	time:O(1)(insert)
	space:O(1)
RouteTrie:
	time:O(n)(both find and insert)
	space:O(1)
Router:
	time:O(n)(both add_handler and lookup)
	space:O(1)
